# Review your code with chatgpt

## Install
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/hunkim/gpt-py-review.git
```

## Review
Set enviroment variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GPT_ENGINE`.
If necessary, also set `REVIEW_PROMPT` and/or `TESTCASE_PROMPT`.


Then run `gpt-py-review yourcode.py`

It will create review comment in md and test cases in test.py.

## Example
### Original Code
```python
# Factorial of a number using recursion

def recur_factorial(n):
   if n == 1:
       return n
   else:
       return n*recur_factorial(n-1)

num = 7

# check if the number is negative
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   print("The factorial of", num, "is", recur_factorial(num))

```

### Reviews
**[DOC] It would be better to include the name and the purpose of the function in the comment.**
**Calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion**

**[BUG] Test cases need to be included to make sure the function is working as expected.**

**[REFACTOR] It appears that the function is checking if n is equal to 1. However, it would be better to include a condition to check if n is less than or equal to 1 in order to handle the case where the input is 0 or less which would result in an error in the current implementation.**

```python
def recur_factorial(n):
   if n <= 1:
      return 1
   else:
      return n*recur_factorial(n-1) 
```     
**[Doc] Add test cases to verify the fixed implementation**
```python
def test_recur_factorial():
   assert recur_factorial(0) == 1 # [TEST] 0! is 1 
   assert recur_factorial(1) == 1 # [TEST] 1! is 1
   assert recur_factorial(2) == 2 # [TEST] 2! is 2
   assert recur_factorial(3) == 6 # [TEST] 3! is 6
   assert recur_factorial(5) == 120 # [TEST] 5! is 120

test_recur_factorial()
```

### Generated Test cases
```python
#Test case :1 the given number is  equals to 1 and output must be 1
def test_recur_factorial_1():
    assert recur_factorial(1) == 1

#Test case :2 the given number is  6 and output must be 720
def test_recur_factorial_2():
    assert recur_factorial(6) == 720

#Test case :3 the given number is  5 and output must be 120
def test_recur_factorial_3():
    assert recur_factorial(5) == 120

#Test case :4 the given number is  negative integer
def test_recur_factorial_4():
    assert recur_factorial(-5) == "It shoud not have negative interger"
    
#Test case :5 the given number is  0 
def test_recur_factorial_5():
    assert recur_factorial(0) == 1
```
